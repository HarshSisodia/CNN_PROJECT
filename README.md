# CNN Transfer Learning Project

This project demonstrates how to use transfer learning with ResNet50 for image classification on the CIFAR-10 dataset. The approach leverages pre-trained weights from ImageNet and adds a custom classification head for the specific task.

## Getting Started

1. Install the required packages:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. Open the notebook:
   ```
   jupyter notebook notebooks/cnn_transfer_learning.ipynb
   ```

3. Follow the step-by-step instructions in the notebook to:
   - Load and preprocess the CIFAR-10 dataset
